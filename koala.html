                        <h3>KOALA</h3>
                        <p>The koala (Phascolarctos cinereus), sometimes inaccurately called the koala bear, is an arboreal herbivorous marsupial native to Australia. 
                            It is the only extant representative of the family Phascolarctidae. Its closest living relatives are the wombats</p>
                           
   <p>The koala is a robust animal with a large head and vestigial or non-existent tail.[10]: 1 [30] It has a body length of 60–85 cm (24–33 in) and a weight of 4–15 kg (8.8–33.1 lb),
    [30] making it among the largest arboreal marsupials.[31] Koalas from Victoria are twice as heavy as those from Queensland.[22]: 7  The species is sexually dimorphic: males are 50% larger than females.
     Males' noses are more curved[31] and sport chest glands, which are visible as bald patches.[22]: 55  The female's pouch opening is secured by a sphincter which holds the young in.[32]</p>

                           <p>You will find the elephants at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
