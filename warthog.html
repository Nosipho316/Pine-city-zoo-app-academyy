                        <h3>GIRAFFE</h3>
                        <p>The giraffe is a large African hoofed mammal belonging to the genus Giraffa. It is the tallest living terrestrial animal and the largest ruminant on Earth.
                             It is classified under the family Giraffidae, along with its closest extant relative, the okapi. Traditionally, giraffes have been thought of as one species, Giraffa camelopardalis, with nine subspecies.</p>
                            <p>The giraffe's distinguishing characteristics are its extremely long neck and legs, horn-like ossicones, and spotted coat patterns.</p>
   
   <p>Fully grown giraffes stand 4.3–5.7 m (14–19 ft) tall, with males taller than females.[47] The average weight is 1,192 kg (2,628 lb) for an adult male and 828 kg (1,825 lb) for an adult female.
    [48] Despite its long neck and legs, its body is relatively short.[49]: 66  The skin is mostly gray[48] or tan,[50] and can reach a thickness of 20 mm (0.79 in).[51]: 87  The 80–100 cm (31–39 in) long[36] tail ends in a long,
     dark tuft of hair and is used as a defense against insects.</p>
                           <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM ?</strong></p>
                           <p>You will find the elephants at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
