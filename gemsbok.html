                        <h3>GEMSBOK</h3>
                        <p>The gemsbok (Oryx gazella), or South African oryx, is a large antelope in the genus Oryx. 
                            It is endemic to the dry and barren regions of Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and (parts of) Zimbabwe, mainly inhabiting the Kalahari and Namib Deserts, areas in which it is supremely adapted for survival. 
                            Previously, some sources classified the related East African oryx, or beisa oryx (Oryx beisa), as a subspecies.</p>
                            <p>The gemsbok is depicted on the coat of arms of Namibia,[20] where the current population of the species is estimated at 373,000 individuals.[1]</p>
   
   <p>The name gemsbok is from Afrikaans, which itself is from the Dutch word of the same spelling, meaning "male chamois", composed of gems (“chamois”) + bok (“buck, male goat”).
     The Dutch gems is further from German Gämse ("chamois"). Although some superficial similarities in appearance (especially in the facial pattern) are noticed, the chamois and the oryx are not closely related.</p>

                           <p>You will find the elephants at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
